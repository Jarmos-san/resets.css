A minimal and unopinionated CSS stylesheet to reset default user-agent styles
for cross-browser compatibility. The CSS style properties provided here -
[`resets.css`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jarmos-san/resets.css/main/resets.css)
are supposed to be used as a source of reference and expanded upon. So feel free
to copy the contents for your frontend projects and make necessary
changes/addendum as you deem fit!

The stylesheet provided in this repository is based on inspirations I picked up
from the resources shared below, so their contributions are much welcomed!

I plan on keeping this project updated to the best of my capabilities and
knowledge. So, if you notice something missing or have a better idea for
something please do not hesitate to open a PR!

## Why you might want to reset the CSS

Resetting a browser's CSS where your project will be viewed from ensures a consistent
starting point for styling, eliminating browser-specific variations and promoting
semantic markup. This practice will save you a lot of headaches in the later part of
development when you want to have a unified look for your project across all browsers
since each browser has its own default CSS that might override the one from your
projects.
