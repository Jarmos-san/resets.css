A minimal and unopinionated CSS stylesheet to reset default user-agent styles
for cross-browser compatability. The CSS style properties provided here -
[`resets.css`](./resets.css) are supposed to be used as a source of reference
and expanded upon. So feel free to copy the contents for your frontend projects
and make necessary changes/addendum as you deem fit!

The stylesheet provided in this repository is based on inspirations I picked up
from the resources shared below, so their contributions are much welcomed!

- [Josh Comeau's Custom CSS Resets](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/)

I plan on keeping this project updated to the best of my capabilities and
knowledge. So, if you notice something missing or have a better idea for
something please do not hesitate to open a PR!
